# Smarter Webpack Banner Plugin

`npm install --save-dev smarter-webpack-banner-plugin`

This is a clone of the Webpack 2 `BannerPlugin` that supports the use of
`[filename]` in the banner string to insert the current chunk's filename.

It was inspired by [smart-banner-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/johvin/smart-banner-webpack-plugin)
